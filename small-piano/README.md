## Small Piano

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org JavaScript projects.
<br />

A piano is a musical instrument consisting of different keys that produce different sounds to create a sweet musical sound when used in a particular sequence. Similarly, a piano app also contains keys that produce different sounds once the user clicks on them and creates different sweet musical sounds with the feeling of playing a real piano.
