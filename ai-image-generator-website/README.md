## AI Image Generator Website

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org JavaScript projects.
<br />

We incorporated API integration to fetch data, providing users with an effortless and dynamic experience in generating AI-driven images. An AI image generator website should have an input bar at the top of it, which simply accepts the text entered by the user and generates an image with the help of AI related to the entered text once the user submits the form or clicks the button to generate the image.
**Note: THIS IS ONLY WEBSITE DESIGN, NO IMAGE GENERATION BACKEND !!**

### Code

- Manages form submission, fetches random images based on entered text, and handles errors.
