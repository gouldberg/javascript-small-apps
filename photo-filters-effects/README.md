# Photo Filters and Effects

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org JavaScript projects.
<br />

Provide a user-friendly interface for adjusting brightness, contrast, gray scale, blur, sepia, and hue rotation filters. Users can also reset the filters to their default values and save the edited image.
<br />

- In HTML structure, we create multiple <input type=”range”> for brightness, contrast, grayscale, blur, sepia, hue rotation, and also an input for image input.
- Style the web page using the class names with CSS properties like font weight for text margins, padding to add space, text-align for alignment, and display type for display styling of individual elements.
- Using JavaScript, develop a function that loads an image from an input source. Additionally, create functions that respond to slider changes, capturing their input values. These values are then utilized to dynamically adjust the filter configurations.
  - Filters: Add filter sliders for brightness, contrast, grayscale, blur, sepia, and hue rotation.
  - Real-time Updates: Apply the selected filters to the image in real-time as users adjust the sliders.
  - Reset Functionality: Implement the reset button to revert all filters to their default values.
  - Image Saving: Allow users to save the edited image with applied filters.
