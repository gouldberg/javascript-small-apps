# Lorem-Ipsum Generator

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org JavaScript projects.

Lorem Ipsum, a placeholder text commonly utilized in the printing and typesetting industry, serves to visually represent a documentâ€™s layout instead of relying on meaningful content.

- The structure of our web application is defined using HTML, where elements for paragraphs, sliders, dropdowns, and buttons are created.
- JavaScript is employed to add interactivity to the application by handling user input, updating displayed values, and generating Lorem Ipsum text.
- Specific JavaScript functions perform tasks like real-time slider value updates, random word generation, and applying HTML tags.
- To dynamically populate the HTML tag selection dropdown, a JavaScript function creates `<option>` elements based on an array of tag options.
- Additionally, event listeners are added to input elements (e.g., sliders, dropdowns) and the generate button to detect user interactions.
