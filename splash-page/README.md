## Splash Page

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org JavaScript projects.
<br />

**The Splash Screen** is the UI element that appears as the initial screen or the loading screen. Splash Page Application consists of a styled animative splash screen effect which automatically makes the curtain opening splash effect into the application for a specific time and renders the dynamic content once the effect is been completed.

### HTML Code

- Create the basic layout or structure of the application using various HTML tags like \<h1\>,\<h3\>,\<div\>, etc.
- Also, **link all the essential external libraries with the CDN links**.
- Create the overall structure for the splash screen inside the **#splash div**. Add all the other animative components like Loading Spinner, title, etc.

### CSS Code

- Style the splash screen, dynamic content, and other elements.
- Also, implement the **keyframe animations** for various effects like bouncing, etc.

### JavaScript Code

- Use the **DOMContentLoaded event to initiate the Splash Screen logic**.
- Set the loading time and hide the splash screen while displaying the dynamic content.
- **DOMContentLoaded event** gets executed once the basic HTML document is loaded and its parsing has taken place. This event doesnâ€™t wait for the completion of the loading of add-ons such as stylesheets, sub-frames and images/pictures.
