## Autoplay Carousel

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org JavaScript projects.
<br />

Create an autoplay carousel that displays colorful content slides. The carousel will automatically transition between slides at regular intervals.
<br />

### HTML Code

- Make **a "carousel" container with "carousel-item" elements for content**.

### CSS Code

- Style container dimensions, background, and item appearance.

### JavaScript Code

- **Manage "active" class, set an interval for auto-rotation (e.g., every 3.5 seconds), and switch items**.
- You can also customize content and adjust the interval for desired behavior. Test and refine as needed.
