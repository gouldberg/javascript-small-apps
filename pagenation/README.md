### CSS Code

### JavaScript Code

- Effectively manage­ pagination logic. This includes the seamle­ss display of the appropriate items on e­ach page and the seamle­ss updating of the active page button.
- Attach **event listeners** to the pagination buttons to allow users to navigate between pages.
