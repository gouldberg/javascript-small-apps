## Analog Clock

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org JavaScript projects.
<br />

Analog clock is a clock that shows the time by using a circular disc and three traditional hour, minute, and second hands.
<br />

### HTML Code

- Simple file having the basic structure of the webpage and ID for the clock's body and for the second, minute, and hour hands.

### CSS Code

- Used just for making the clock actually look a bit nicer. We have basically centered our clock in the middle of the webpage.

### JavaScript Code

Provide the logic behind the rotation of the hands.

- First, we have selected the hour, minute, and second from HTML.
- To get the current time we have used the **Date() object** provided by the JavaScript. This will give the current seconds, minutes, and hours respectively.
- Now, we have got our hour, minute, and second, and we know that the clock rotates 360 degrees. So, we will convert to convert the rotation of the hands of the clock into degrees. The degree calculation is based on a simple unary method.
