## Resize and Compress Image

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org JavaScript projects.
<br />

- For resizing and compressing the image, we will first prompt the user to load the image in the application.
- Once the user uploads the image, a basic preview of the image is displayed to the user, and then the user needs to be given the desired ratio of width and height, as well as the provision to set the quality of the image by dynamically adjusting the quality bar.
- When the user does the customization, the user needs to press the button.
- After pressing the button, the image gets resized and compressed.
- Simultaneously, the preview gets updated, and the download button is pressed.
- The user can download the image by clicking on this button.
