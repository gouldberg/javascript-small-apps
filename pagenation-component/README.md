Websites may need multiple pages to display the items for easier navigation and better user experiences. If you are looking to display large amounts of data on your site, like a blog, charts, or graphs that show information about the same data set, you will surely need to split these data into various pages for improved readability.

Pagination comes to the rescue in such a problem. It is a connected sequence of web pages that have similar content. The content of a section is divided into multiple pages with the help of pagination.
<br />

- We initialize the constants for “itemsPerPage” and the “totalItems”. We set up variables to keep track of the current page.
- We create a function to generate the content based on the current page. We also update the HTML content in it.
- We create a function to generate pagination links and arrow buttons.
- We attach click-based event listeners to pagination links and arrow buttons. When the pagination link is created, update the current page and update the pagination
- Now we call the content and pagination function.
