Websites may need **multiple pages to display the items for easier navigation** and better user experiences. If you are looking to display large amounts of data on your site, like a blog, charts, or graphs that show information about the same data set, you will surely need to split these data into various pages for improved readability.

Pagination comes to the rescue in such a problem. It is a connected sequence of web pages that have similar content. The content of a section is divided into multiple pages with the help of pagination.
