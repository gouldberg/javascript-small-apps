## Chips Component

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org JavaScript projects.
<br />

In a chip component, there are basically two sections: one is the **content section**, and the other is the **cross-button section.** Both should be under one container with a proper **border-radius**.
<br />

### HTML Code

### CSS Code

### JavaScript Code

- Then, link the JavaScript and CSS files to the HTML file.
