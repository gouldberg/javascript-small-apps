# Chips Component

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org JavaScript projects.
<br />

In a chip component, there are basically two sections: one is the content section, and the other is the cross-button section. Both should be under one container with a proper border-radius.
<br />

- Create an HTML structure for the chips component with proper ids and classes for the styles.
- Add a CSS file that contains all the styles related to the chip component.
- Add a JavaScript file with all the logic to create the chip and delete it.
- Then, link the JavaScript and CSS files to the HTML file.
